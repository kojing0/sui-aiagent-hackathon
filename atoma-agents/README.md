# Atoma Sage

Built on the Sui blockchain and powered by Atoma Network's AI Infrastructure, AtomaSage are sets of extensible Intelligent Layer system for blockchain operations. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for interacting with various blockchain protocols through natural language processing.

## Vision

Our goal is to create a full-fledged agent system using the Atoma's distributed AI computation that can handle complex blockchain operations through simple natural language commands. By leveraging AI, we're making blockchain interactions more accessible and intuitive for both developers and users.

## Features

- 🤖 Natural Language Processing for blockchain operations
- 🔄 Protocol-agnostic design (currently supporting Aftermath Finance on Sui)
- 💰 Token price queries and tracking
- 🏊‍♂️ Pool management and analysis
- 📊 APR calculations and tracking
- 💸 Transaction handling
- 🔍 Advanced pool filtering and ranking

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/atoma-network/atoma-agents.git

# Install dependencies
cd atoma-agents
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

The server will start on port 2512 by default.

### Using the Agent Package Directly

You can also use the Sui Agent package directly in your TypeScript/JavaScript applications:

```typescript
import Agent from '@atoma-agents/sui-agent/src/agents/SuiAgent';

// Initialize the agent with your Atoma SDK bearer token
const suiAgent = new Agent('your_atoma_sdk_bearer_token');

// Use the agent to process queries
async function processQuery(query: string) {
  try {
    const result = await suiAgent.SuperVisorAgent(query);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing query:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

Example usage in an Express route:

```typescript
import Agent from '@atoma-agents/sui-agent/src/agents/SuiAgent';

const suiAgent = new Agent(config.atomaSdkBearerAuth);

app.post('/query', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { query } = req.body;
    const result = await suiAgent.SuperVisorAgent(query);
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

## Usage

You can interact with the agent using either cURL or Postman.

### Using cURL

```bash
# Example query
curl -X POST http://localhost:2512/v1/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "what is the price of sui and btc"}'
```

### Using Postman

1. Create a new POST request to `http://localhost:2512/v1/query`
2. Set the Content-Type header to `application/json`
3. In the request body, add your query:

```json
{
  "query": "what is the price of sui and btc"
}
```

## Sample Queries

Here are some example queries you can try:

- "What is the current price of SUI and BTC?"
- "Show me the top 5 pools by TVL"
- "Get pool information for [pool_id]"
- "Send 1 SUI to [wallet_address]"
- "What's the APR for [token_address]?"
- "Show me pools with minimum TVL of $100,000"
- "Deposit 1 SUI into each of the top 5 pools by APR from my wallet [address]"
- "Find the top 3 pools by TVL and deposit 0.5 SUI into each with 0.5% slippage"
- "Deposit 2 SUI each into the top 10 pools by fees using 1% slippage"
- "Withdraw 1000000 LP tokens from pool [pool_id] with 0.5% slippage"
- "Show me the top pools by APR and help me deposit into them"

## Adding New Protocols

The system is designed to be easily extensible. To add a new protocol:

1. Create a new directory under `src/` for your protocol
2. Implement your tool functions following the existing patterns
3. Register your tools in `src/tools/ToolRegistry.ts`

Example structure for adding a new protocol:

```typescript
// src/yourprotocol/YourTool.ts
export async function yourToolFunction(param1: string): Promise<string> {
  // Implementation
}

// In ToolRegistry.ts
tools.registerTool(
  'your_tool_name',
  'Description of what your tool does',
  [
    {
      name: 'param1',
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Description of the parameter',
      required: true
    }
  ],
  yourToolFunction
);
```
